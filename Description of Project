Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn occurs when a customer stops using a company's product or service. Predicting churn early helps businesses take action to improve customer retention.
✨ Objectives
Identify the key factors contributing to customer churn.
Build a predictive model to classify whether a customer will leave.
Help businesses reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.


📊 Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, usage behavior, billing information, and service details.
Common features: contract type, monthly charges, tenure, payment method, etc.


🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost / LightGBM 
Neural Network 
Model performance was evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision & Recall
